# Website Summarizer

This project uses the **Gemini API** to scrape and summarize the content of a website. It extracts the title and main text from a given URL, removes irrelevant elements (like scripts and styles), and generates a concise summary using the Gemini API.

---

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extracts the title and main text content from a website.
- **Content Cleaning**: Removes irrelevant HTML elements (e.g., scripts, styles, images).
- **AI Summarization**: Uses the Gemini API to generate a markdown-formatted summary of the website content.
- **IPython Support**: Displays the summary in markdown format in Jupyter notebooks or IPython environments.

   ```

3. Set up your environment:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:
